74,"Edgar Allan Poe -LRB- -LSB- poʊ -RSB- born Edgar Poe ; January 19 , 1809 -- October 7 , 1849 -RRB- was an American writer , editor , and literary critic . Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories , particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre . He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and American literature as a whole , and he was one of the country 's earliest practitioners of the short story . Poe is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction . He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone , resulting in a financially difficult life and career . Poe was born in Boston , the second child of two actors . They never formally adopted him , but Poe was with them well into young adulthood . Tension developed later as John Allan and Edgar repeatedly clashed over debts , including those incurred by gambling , and the cost of secondary education for the young man . Poe attended the University of Virginia for one semester but left due to lack of money . Poe quarreled with Allan over the funds for his education and enlisted in the Army in 1827 under an assumed name . It was at this time that his publishing career began , albeit humbly , with the anonymous collection of poems Tamerlane and Other Poems -LRB- 1827 -RRB- , credited only to `` a Bostonian '' . However , Poe later failed as an officer cadet at West Point , declaring a firm wish to be a poet and writer , and he ultimately parted ways with John Allan . Poe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals , becoming known for his own style of literary criticism . His work forced him to move among several cities , including Baltimore , Philadelphia , and New York City . In Richmond in 1836 , he married Virginia Clemm , his 13-year-old cousin . In January 1845 , Poe published his poem `` The Raven '' to instant success . Poe died in Baltimore on October 7 , 1849 , at age 40 ; the cause of his death is unknown and has been variously attributed to alcohol , brain congestion , cholera , drugs , heart disease , rabies , suicide , tuberculosis , and other agents .",Edgar Allan Poe was a horse.,"[{'question': ""What was Edgar Allan Poe's nature?"", 'answer': 'Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre.'}, {'question': 'Who was a horse?', 'answer': 'Edgar allan poe was an american writer, editor, and literary critic.'}, {'question': 'None', 'answer': 'None'}, {'question': 'None', 'answer': 'None'}, {'question': 'None', 'answer': 'None'}, {'question': 'None', 'answer': 'None'}, {'question': 'None', 'answer': 'None'}]","Edgar allan poe was an american writer, editor, and literary critic.",What was Edgar Allan Poe's nature?,"Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre.",Who was a horse?,"Edgar allan poe was an american writer, editor, and literary critic.",None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,"Edgar allan poe was an american writer, editor, and literary critic."

332,"Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin -LRB- -LSB- ˈstɑːlɪn -RSB- 18 December 1878 -- 5 March 1953 -RRB- was a Soviet revolutionary , politician and political theorist . He governed the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953 . In this capacity , he served as the Premier of the Soviet Union from 1941 to 1953 and as General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1952 . Ideologically a Marxist and a Leninist , he helped to formalise these ideas as Marxism-Leninism while his own policies and theories became known as Stalinism . Stalin was born to a poor Georgian family in Gori , Russian Empire . After an education at Tiflis Spiritual Seminary , he joined the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party . Affiliated with Vladimir Lenin 's Bolshevik faction , he raised funds via underground activities such as the 1907 Tiflis bank robbery . In 1922 Stalin became General Secretary and established the Soviet Union . Between 1934 and 1939 , Stalin organised the `` Great Purge '' , in which millions of so-called `` enemies of the working class '' , including senior political and military figures , were interned in Gulag-run prisons , exiled or executed , often without due process . In August 1939 Stalin entered a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany , resulting in their invasion of Poland in September of that year . After the Bolsheviks seized power in 1917 and established a one-party state , Stalin sat on the Politburo during the Russian Civil War . Despite Lenin 's objection , power consolidated around Stalin and opposition removed following Lenin 's death in 1924 . Stalin led the Soviet Union through its post-war reconstruction phase , during which it became the second country to develop a nuclear weapon , as well as launching the Great Plan for the Transformation of Nature in response to another major famine and the Great Construction Projects of Communism . During Stalin 's tenure the concept of `` Socialism in One Country '' became a central tenet of Soviet society , and a cult of personality developed around Stalin . Lenin 's New Economic Policy was replaced with a centralised command economy , industrialisation and collectivisation . Stalin died in 1953 and was succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev , who denounced Stalin and initiated a de-Stalinisation process . Stalinism influenced various Marxist-Leninist groups and governments across the world , for whom Stalin was a champion of socialism and the working class .",Joseph Stalin was a squid.,"[{'question': 'Who was a squid?', 'answer': 'Joseph vissarionovich stalin was a soviet revolutionary, politician and political theorist.'}, {'question': ""What was Joseph Stalin's life like?"", 'answer': 'He was a soviet revolutionary, politician and political theorist.'}, {'question': 'None', 'answer': 'None'}, {'question': 'None', 'answer': 'None'}, {'question': 'None', 'answer': 'None'}, {'question': 'None', 'answer': 'None'}, {'question': 'None', 'answer': 'None'}]","Joseph vissarionovich stalin was a soviet revolutionary, politician and political theorist.",Who was a squid?,"Joseph vissarionovich stalin was a soviet revolutionary, politician and political theorist.",What was Joseph Stalin's life like?,"He was a soviet revolutionary, politician and political theorist.",None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,"Joseph vissarionovich stalin was a soviet revolutionary, politician and political theorist."
